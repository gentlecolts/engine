engine
======

the purpose of this project is to approach the challenge of voxel animation (an probably memory management at some point), voxel-engine-1, my previous voxel engine, was too disorganized, i was refining and changing my method as i went, so it just ended up as a huge mess, now that i know what i am going to do, i am starting over with this repo
